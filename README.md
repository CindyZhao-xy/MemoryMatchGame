# MemoryMatchGame

Created a memory game using various shapes. The user interface should show 20 cards, in 5 rows and 4 columns. 
The user can click on a card and see what is on the other side. 
The user then clicks on a second card to see what shape is under that card. 
If the two cards match, then they are removed from the interface and some happy sound file should be played. 
Otherwise, they should be flipped over and the user can continue clicking on cards, and a sad sound file should be played.
